## Ideas

### Data collection
- Source from HLTV
- Scrape using BeautifulSoup?

### Emulator
- GP mapping from (team, team) to (win probability) ??
- Implement TrueSkill & Glicko for comparison

### Simulator
- Decide on a acquisition function???

## Unknowns
- Do we model skill on a per-player basis or a per-team basis?
- How do we handle changing rosters?
